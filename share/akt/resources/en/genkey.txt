akt genkey: generate or manage simple named keys to lock/unlock wallets

Usage: genkey [--remove] {<name> ...}

  The genkey command is used to generate or remove a password key file
  stored in some safe location on the file system (see the keys
  configuration variable).  The password key file can then be used
  with the --passkey option.  It provides the same security level as using the
  --passfile option but helps in setting up and using separate key files
  for different wallets.
