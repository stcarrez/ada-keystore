--  == Keystore ==
--  The `Keystore` package provides operations to store information in secure wallets and
--  protect the stored information by encrypting the content.  It is necessary to know one
--  of the wallet password to access its content.  Wallets are protected by a master key
--  using AES-256 and the wallet master key is protected by a user password.  The wallet
--  defines up to 7 slots that identify a password key that is able to unlock the master key.
--  To open a wallet, it is necessary to unlock one of the 7 slots by providing the correct
--  password.  Wallet key slots are protected by the user's password and the PBKDF2-HMAC-256
--  algorithm, a random salt, a random counter and they are encrypted using AES-256.
--
--  === Creation ===
--  To create a keystore you will first declare a `Wallet_File` instance.  You will also need
--  a password that will be used to protect the wallet master key.
--
--    with Keystore.Files;
--    ...
--      WS   : Keystore.Files.Wallet_File;
--      Pass : Keystore.Secret_Key := Keystore.Create ("There was no choice but to be pioneers");
--
--  You can then create the keystore file by using the `Create` operation:
--
--      WS.Create ("secure.akt", Pass);
--
--  === Storing ===
--  Values stored in the wallet are protected by their own encryption keys using AES-256.
--  The encryption key is generated when the value is added to the wallet by using the `Add`
--  operation.
--
--      WS.Add ("Grace Hopper", "If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it.");
--
--  The `Get` function allows to retrieve the value.  The value is decrypted only when the `Get`
--  operation is called.
--
--      Citation : constant String := WS.Get ("Grace Hopper");
--
--  The `Delete` procedure can be used to remove the value.  When the value is removed,
--  the encryption key and the data are erased.
--
--      WS.Delete ("Grace Hopper");
